## Agenda
1. General: What is the idea of the Research Paper Graph?
   - Use Case 1: Research Paper Graph:
        - Display related papers
        - Filter/sort papers by rankings
        - Show paper descriptions
        - Analyse the similarity of paper contents
        - Color-code research areas
  
   - Use Case 2: Researcher Graph

2. Are we building an app or a web application?
   - Web application:
        - Web application suits the seminar scope
        - Researchers work with their laptops, not their phones

3. How do we define/describe the Research Paper Graph?
   - Displays references of one paper, groups of papers/research areas, popular/related researchers
   - Filtering
   - Zooming by metric (may be interactively defined): https://i.imgur.com/KE3WXyX.png
   - Display subgraph by field/discipline
   - Time series/development of references

4. What is the motivation for a Research Paper Graph?
   - Researcher Graph:
        - Appointments committee
        - Expert invitations from German Government
        - Objective view on how popular a researcher is
   - Research Paper Graph:
        - Relationships between papers
        - Relationships between research fields

5. What should the user interface for the Research Paper Graph look like?
    - https://marvelapp.com/d3c33g7

6. With which paper do we want to start the implementation?
    - We'll sort that out later.

7. What is our first Use Case?
   - Research Paper Graph: Present a small network of 40 papers and how they interconnect.

8. From which API do we collect research papers and their references?
 - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/help/api with terms of use https://arxiv.org/help/api/tou
 - Google Scholar: [not well-suited](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/34970/how-to-get-permission-from-google-to-use-google-scholar-data-if-needed), but there is a nice [python script](https://pypi.org/project/scholarly/)
 - Clarivate: [Requires licenses, what do licenses enable us to?](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/xml-and-apis/) 
 - Semanticscholar: [Data can be accessed via API and downloaded](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)
    - Example from semanticscholar:  
        ```{"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","pmid":"","year":2012,"outCitations":[],"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dd102194310d8afd369fdfa40f1a02f8819ab449","s2PdfUrl":"","id":"dd102194310d8afd369fdfa40f1a02f8819ab449","authors":[{"name":"Arvidsson Karin","ids":["146100869"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Om ordens makt och maktens ord","doi":"10.6027/9789289341271-11-sv","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.6027/9789289341271-11-sv","venue":""}```

9. Are we interested in time series (i.e. how popular is the paper over time)?
   - Yes. 
   - Reconstructable by publishing dates of papers

10. Which database do we want to use?
    - No explicit time series database.
    - Postgres

11. In which languages will we implement the Research Paper Graph?
    - Scraping (Python)
    - Backend  (Python)
    - Frontend (Typescript, React)

12. What other technologies do we want to use? 
 - Chart/Graph libraries:
   - https://www.chartjs.org/
   - https://www.echartsjs.com/
   - https://d3js.org/

13. What milestones will we set and who will do what?
   - Start with scraping the data and filling the database
   - No team division by implementation layers (however, Alvaro tends towards UI)
