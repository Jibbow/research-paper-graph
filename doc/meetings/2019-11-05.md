## Agenda
1. General: What is the idea of the Research Paper Graph?

2. Are we building an app or a web application?

3. How do we define/describe the Research Paper Graph?

4. What is the motivation for a Research Paper Graph?

5. What should the user interface for the Research Paper Graph look like?

6. With which paper do we want to start the implementation?

7. What is our first Use Case?

8. From which API do we collect research papers and their references?
 - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/help/api with terms of use https://arxiv.org/help/api/tou
 - Google Scholar is apparently [not well-suited](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/34970/how-to-get-permission-from-google-to-use-google-scholar-data-if-needed), but there is a nice [python script](https://pypi.org/project/scholarly/)

9. Are we interested in time series (i.e. how popular is the paper over time)?

10. Which database do we want to use? 

11. In which languages will we implement the Research Paper Graph?

12. What other technologies do we want to use? 
 - Chart/Graph libraries:
   - https://www.chartjs.org/
   - https://www.echartsjs.com/
   - https://d3js.org/

13. What milestones will we set?
