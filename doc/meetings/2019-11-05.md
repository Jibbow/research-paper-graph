## Agenda
1. General: What is the idea of the Research Paper Graph?
   Two use-cases: Paper oriented and person oriented
   - Related papers, rankings, description of paper, similarity of content between papers, display in graph, coloring for research areas

2. Are we building an app or a web application?
   - Web application (students will use computer, need to build web application) yeah! :D

3. How do we define/describe the Research Paper Graph?
   - References of one paper
   - Groups of papers/Research areas
   - Experts/popular or related researchers
   - Filtering papers
   - Zooming by metric (may be interactively defined): https://i.imgur.com/KE3WXyX.png
   - Display subgraph by field/discipline
   - Time series/development of references

4. What is the motivation for a Research Paper Graph?
   - Berufungskommission
   - more objective view on how popular a researcher is
   - relations between papers
   - relations between research fields
   - German Government invites experts from Academia; select profressors more objectively (how essential is a person in the graph, find experts)

5. What should the user interface for the Research Paper Graph look like?

6. With which paper do we want to start the implementation?

7. What is our first Use Case?
   - Present a small network of 40 papers and how they interconnect.

8. From which API do we collect research papers and their references?
 - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/help/api with terms of use https://arxiv.org/help/api/tou
 - Google Scholar is apparently [not well-suited](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/34970/how-to-get-permission-from-google-to-use-google-scholar-data-if-needed), but there is a nice [python script](https://pypi.org/project/scholarly/)
 - https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/xml-and-apis/ costs something, but the University has licenses(?) -> what are we allowed to do with these licenses?
 - https://api.semanticscholar.org/, we can download an access API
 - Example from semanticscholar:  
   ```{"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","pmid":"","year":2012,"outCitations":[],"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dd102194310d8afd369fdfa40f1a02f8819ab449","s2PdfUrl":"","id":"dd102194310d8afd369fdfa40f1a02f8819ab449","authors":[{"name":"Arvidsson Karin","ids":["146100869"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Om ordens makt och maktens ord","doi":"10.6027/9789289341271-11-sv","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.6027/9789289341271-11-sv","venue":""}```

9. Are we interested in time series (i.e. how popular is the paper over time)?
   Yes. (we can easily reconstruct the info we want because we have the publishing date of papers)

10. Which database do we want to use?
    - No explicit time series database.
    - Postgres

11. In which languages will we implement the Research Paper Graph?
    - Scraping (independent, problably Python)
    - Backend  (Python)
    - Frontend (Typescript, React)

12. What other technologies do we want to use? 
 - Chart/Graph libraries:
   - https://www.chartjs.org/
   - https://www.echartsjs.com/
   - https://d3js.org/

13. What milestones will we set and who will do what?
    - Ecosystem: Shared database in which we can load data and which we can query

    - Team Forming: Based on what we like to do (Alvaro probably UI)
